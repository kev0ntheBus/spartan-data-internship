* What felt easy: The SQL definitely felt easy up to subqueries as I had forgotten it. Python was easy of course but it's only basic python for today

* What felt challenging: Trying to remember any of this from the depths of my brain. Once I saw the review in practice though then I remembered it much more.

* What you learned: Very basic starting points for python and SQL again but it's okay, it's only day 1.

* What you want to improve tomorrow: I want to be able to remember with no prior prompting or review the basic syntax for the python functions we did today as well as the types of queries in SQL. I will review over everything tonight before bed to try to hardwire the thougts of them in my head
